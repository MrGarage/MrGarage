# Hello! I'm Rohan Gorajia

### About Me

I am currently a student at Rutgers University, completing my Masters Degree in Computer Engineering in May of 2024. I completed my Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Music Technology in 2023. 

All of my projects, in both classes and outside of  classes can be seen on [my Github].

I have written two research papers, and they are both able to be read under [Research Papers].

Currently, outside of classes and teams that I am on, I am working on building a [hardware synthesizer from scratch].
